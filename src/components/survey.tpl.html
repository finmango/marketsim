            No form of investment is <b>risk-free</b>. Even if you choose not to invest in the
            stock market, cash is subject to loss of value due to <b>inflation</b>. Since it's not
            possible to avoid any type of risk, a more successful strategy is to understand the
            risks associated with different types of investments and work on a plan which fits your
            timelines and risk tolerance.

            they affect your investments over the short and long term.

            What is the Stock Market?
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            When people say <b>stock market</b>, also known as equity market, they typically refer
            to the collection of markets and exchanges where one can purchase <b>stocks</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            For the purpose of this lesson, stocks can be simply thought of as partial ownership of
            a company. This is why they are also known as <b>shares</b> — because a group of
            investors share the ownership of the company. When you own shares worth 1% of a company,
            you are entitled to 1% of the money the company earns after all the expenses are paid —
            these are called <b>dividends</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            Similarly, when the company grows in value, the value of your shares grows
            proportionally. If you own 1% of a company when it's worth $1 million, your investment
            is worth $10,000. If the company grows and its total value becomes $10 million, then the
            fraction of the company that you own is worth $100,000.
        </p>

            Positive and Negative Returns
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            A company's dividends given to shareholders can never be negative; they can however be
            zero, and this is the case with many of the companies in the stock market. That doesn't
            necessarily mean that a company is strictly unprofitable, it could mean that a company
            chooses to reinvest all of its profits into its continued growth.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            On the other hand, how much a company is worth can decrease in value. Even though a
            company can never be worth a negative value, your investment returns can have negative
            growth. For example, if you own shares of a company and its value decreased by half,
            then half of the money you invested in that company will be lost. In the worst case
            scenario, a company can go bankrupt and your shares of that company will be worthless.

            Stock Market Volatility
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            Because of the potential negative returns, your investments in the stock market can in
            fact decrease in value. The ups and downs in the stock market are known as
            <b>market volatility</b>. This scares many risk-averse people, who prefer to keep their
            savings out of the stock market altogether. We at <b>FinMango</b> strongly encourage
            everyone instead to learn about the risks and deploy a strategy that serves your
            long-term goals.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            Picking an individual company is more risky than investing in several of them, since
            any one company can fail; but the more companies you invest in the less likely it is
            that they will all fail. An extreme example of this are <b>index funds</b>.

            Evaluating and Mitigating Risk
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            <b>Index funds</b> are a financial instrument which allow you to invest in a large
            number of companies, minimizing the risk of all of them going bankrupt virtually to
            zero. They are widely considered the safest way to invest in the stock market, with a
            proven track record going back many decades.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            While the stock market as a whole has had periods of negative growth, which in economic
            terms are known as <b>recessions</b>, historically it has always recovered and surpassed
            its previous historically high values. This essentially means that, if you are a patient
            investor, there has <b>never been a bad time</b> in history to invest in the stock
            market.
