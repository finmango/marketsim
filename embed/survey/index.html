            No form of investment is <b>risk-free</b>. Even if you choose not to invest on the
            market, cash is subject to loss of value due to <b>inflation</b>. Since it's not
            possible to avoid any type of risk, a more successful strategy is to understand the
            risks associated with different types of investments and work on a plan which fits your
            timelines and risk tolerance.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            This tool was designed to let you explore the effect of different risk levels and how
            they affect your investments over the short and long term.

            What is the Stock Market?
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            When people say <b>stock market</b>, also known as equity market, they typically refer
            to the collection of markets and exchanges where one can purchase <b>stocks</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            For the purpose of this lesson, stocks can be simply thought of as partial ownership of
            a company. This is why they are also known as <b>shares</b> — because a group of
            investors share the ownership of the company. When you own shares worth 1% of a company,
            you are entitled to 1% of the money the company earns after all the expenses are paid —
            these are called <b>dividends</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            Similarly, when the company grows in value, the value of your shares grows
            proportionally. When you own 1% of a company when it's worth $1 million, that is worth
            $10,000. If the company grows and its worth becomes $10 million, then the fraction of
            the company that you own is worth $100,000.
        </p>

    <div class="screen animated">

        <h2 class="centered">
            Positive and Negative Returns
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            A company's dividends given to shareholders can never be negative; they can however be
            zero, and this is the case with many of the companies in the stock market. That doesn't
            necessarily mean that a company is strictly unprofitable, it could mean that a company
            chooses to reinvest all profits into its continued growth.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            On the other hand, how much a company is worth can decrease in value. Even though a
            company can never be worth a negative value, your investment returns can have negative
            growth. For example, if you own 1% of a company and its value decreased by half, then
            half of the money you invested in that company will be lost. In the worst case scenario,
            a company can go bankrupt and your shares of that company will be worthless.
        </p>

            Stock Market Volatility
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            Because of the potential negative returns, your investments in the stock market can in
            fact decrease in value. The ups and downs in the stock market are known as
            <b>market volatility</b> This scares many risk-averse people, who prefer to keep all of
            their savings out of the stock market altogether. We at <b>FinMango</b> strongly
            encourage everyone instead to learn about the risks and deploy a strategy that serves
            your long-term goals.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            Picking and individual company is more risky than investing in several of them, since
            any one company can fail but the more companies you invest in the less likely it is that
            they will all fail. An extreme example of this are <b>index funds</b>.
        </p>

            Evaluating and Mitigating Risk
        </h2>

        <p class="centered one">
            <b>Index funds</b> are a financial instrument which allow you to invest in a large
            number of companies, minimizing the risk of all of them going bankrupt virtually to
            zero. They are widely considered the safest way to invest in the stock market, with a
            proven track record going back over a century.
        </p>

        <p class="centered one">
            While the stock market as a whole has had periods of negative growth, which in economic
            terms are known as <b>recessions</b>, historically it has always recovered and surpassed
            previous historical high values. This essentially means that, if you were a patient
            enough investor, there has <b>never been a bad time</b> in history to invest in the
            stock market.
